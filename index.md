# 🍳 My Recipe Collection

Welcome to my personal recipe book — a mix of automatically scraped dinner ideas and my own favorite dishes.  
Everything here updates automatically every Monday. 🕒

## 📚 Sections

### 🥘 [Weekly Recipes](./recipes/weekly_recipes.md)
Easy dinners for 2–3 people, scraped from trusted sources and updated weekly.

### 👨‍🍳 [My Recipes](./recipes/my_recipes.md)
My personal favorites and saved recipes — imported automatically whenever I add new links.

## 🧭 How It Works
This project uses GitHub Actions to:
- Scrape new dinner recipes every Monday morning.  
- Add my own recipe links from [`data/my_recipe_links.txt`](./data/my_recipe_links.txt).  
- Automatically publish this site via GitHub Pages.
